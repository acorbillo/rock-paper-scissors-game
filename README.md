# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors Game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this version, you can play against the computer, and the game ends after each round with an option to play again.

## Getting Started

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
4. The game will load, and you will see the game interface.

## Game Rules

The game follows the standard rules of Rock Paper Scissors:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

To play, simply click on one of the available choices (rock, paper, or scissors). The computer opponent will also make a random choice, and the winner will be determined based on the rules mentioned above. The game will display the result of the round.

## Playing Again

After each round, you have the option to play again. If you want to play another round, click the "Play Again" button. This will reset the game, and you can make a new choice against the computer.

## Future Improvements

In the future, the developer plans to add a scoreboard to keep track of the player's score. This will enhance the gaming experience by allowing you to see your progress and compare scores over multiple rounds.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the game interface.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styles for the game.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.
